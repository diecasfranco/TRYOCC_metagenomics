Repository containing bioinformatic pipelines and supplementary material for the project **"Facultatively intra-bacterial localization of a planthopper symbiont as an apparent adaptation to its vertical transmission."**
_
Here we demonstrate an unusual transmission strategy adapted by one of the endosymbionts of the planthopper Trypetimorpha occidentalis (Hemiptera: Tropiduchidae) from Bulgaria. In this species, an Acetobacteraceae endosymbiont is transmitted transovarially within deep invaginations of cellular membranes of an ancient endosymbiont Sulcia - strikingly resembling recently described way of plant virus transmission. However, Acetobacteraceae co-colonizes the same bacteriocytes as Sulcia but does not enter its cells in males.  Then, the unusual endobacterial localization of Acetobacteraceae observed in females appears to be a unique adaptation to maternal transmission._
